### **Tuple Methods**
| Method  | Description                                                                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| count() | Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple                         |
| index() | Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found |

* Tuple **count()** Method
```python
thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
x = thistuple.count(5)
print(x)

Output:- 2
```
* Tuple **index()** Method:- Search for the first occurrence of the value 8, and return its position.
```python
thistuple = (1, 3, 7, 8, 7, 5, 4, 6, 8, 5)
x = thistuple.index(8)
print(x)

Output:- 3
```


### **Ques. Difference between List and Tuples in Python?**
|                                                     List                                                     |                                            Tuples                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                   List is mutable. i.e they can be edited.                                   |                 Tuple is immutable. (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).                 |
|                               List iteration is slower and is time consuming.                                |                                  Tuple iteration is faster.                                   |
|                            List is useful for insertion and deletion operations.                             |               Tuple is useful for readonly operations like accessing elements.                |
|                                           List has a large memory.                                           |                                   Tuple has a small memory.                                   |
| List is stored in two blocks of memory (One is fixed sized and the other is variable sized for storing data) |                         Tuple is stored in a single block of memory.                          |
|                                     List provides many in-built methods.                                     |                              Tuples have less in-built methods.                               |
|                                     List operations are more error prone                                     |                                  Tuples operations are safe.                                  |
|      A list has data stored in  square brackets [] brackets. For example, list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]       | A tuple has data stored in parantheses () brackets. For example, tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20) |



### **Ques. Convert a list into a tuple?**
```python
# Using tuple() builtin function
list = [1,2,3,4]
result = tuple(list)
print(type(result))

Output:- <class 'tuple'>
-------------------------------------------------------------

# Using loop inside the tuple
sample_list = ['Compile', 'With', 'Favtutor']
tuple1 = tuple(i for i in sample_list)
print(tuple1)

Output:- ('Compile', 'With', 'Favtutor')
-------------------------------------------------------------

# Unpack list inside the parenthesis
sample_list = ['Compile', 'With', 'Favtutor']

#unpack list items and form tuple
tuple1 = (*sample_list,)

print(tuple1)
print(type(tuple1))

Output:- 
('Compile', 'With', 'Favtutor')
<class 'tuple'>
```

### **Ques. How to Sort List Of Tuples By The First Element?**
```python
tup= [('C#',1), ('Go',7), ('Basic',8), ('Python',60)]
tup.sort()  
print(tup)

Output:- [('Basic', 8), ('C#', 1), ('Go', 7), ('Python', 60)]
```

### **Ques. How to Sort List Of Tuples By Second Element?**
```python
tup= [('C#',1), ('Go',7), ('Basic',8), ('Python',60)]
tup.sort(key = lambda x:x[1])
print(tup)

Output:- [('C#', 1), ('Go', 7), ('Basic', 8), ('Python', 60)]
