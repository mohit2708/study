### Ques. Loop Dictionaries?
```python
# print Dictionaries by key, value and item
a = {1:12 ,2:11 ,4:16 ,3:14 ,6:15 ,5:13 }
print(sorted(a.keys()))
print(sorted(a.values()))
print(sorted(a.items()))

Output:-
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
[(1, 12), (2, 11), (3, 14), (4, 16), (5, 13), (6, 15)]
```

* Print **all key names** in the dictionary, one by one.
```python
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)

Output:- 
brand
model
year
```

* Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
```python
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

Output:- 
Ford
Mustang
1964
```

* We can use the **keys()** method to return the keys of a dictionary:

```python
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)

Output:-
brand
model
year
```

* You can also use the **values()** method to return values of a dictionary:
```python
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

Output:-
Ford
Mustang
1964
```
* Loop through both keys and values, by using the **items()** method.
```python
thisdict =	{
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

Output:-
brand Ford
model Mustang
year 1964
```
