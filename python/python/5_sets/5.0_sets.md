### Ques. What is Set?
* Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* Duplicate items are not allowed.
* A set is a collection which is both **unordered**, **unindexed** and **unchangeable**.
* Set items are **unchangeable**, but you can remove items and add new items.
* Sets are **unordered**, so we cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
* Sets are written with **curly{}** brackets.

* Example:-
```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", False, "cherry", 0, "apple", True, 1, 2}
print(thisset)

Output:- {True, 2, 'cherry', 'apple', 'banana'}
again hit output:- {False, True, 2, 'cherry', 'banana', 'apple'}
```

#### Note:-
* Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
* **Unordered** means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
* **Sets are unchangeable**, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.(Once a set is created, you cannot change its items, but you can add new items.)

* Sets do not allow **duplicate** values.
```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
print(thisset)

Output:- {'banana', 'apple', 'cherry'}
```

* Set items can be of any data type.(String, int and boolean)
```python
set1 = {"abc", 34, True, 40, "male"}
print(set1)
output:- {True, 34, 40, 'male', 'abc'}
```

* The values **True and 1** are considered the **same value in sets**, and are treated as duplicates.
```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", True, 1, 2}
print(thisset)

Output:- {True, 2, 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}
```

* The values **False** and **0** are considered the same value in sets, and are treated as duplicates.
```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", False, 16, 0}
print(thisset)

Output:- {False, 16, 'banana', 'cherry', 'apple'}
```


### Ques. Get the Length of a Set?
```python
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(len(thisset))
Output:- 3
```

### Ques. set() Constructor?
* It is also possible to use the set() constructor to make a set(the double round-brackets).
```python
thisset = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
print(thisset)
output:- {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}
```

### Ques. Loop Sets?
```python
# Loop Items
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
for x in thisset:
  print(x)
			
Output:- 
banana
cherry
apple
```
