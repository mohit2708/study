### Ques. Switch Statements?
* The match statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
* Instead of writing many **if..else statements**, you can use the match statement.
```python
lang = input("What's the programming language you want to learn? ")

match lang:
    case "JavaScript":
        print("You can become a web developer.")

    case "Python":
        print("You can become a Data Scientist")

    case "PHP":
        print("You can become a backend developer")
    
    case "Solidity":
        print("You can become a Blockchain developer")

    case "Java":
        print("You can become a mobile app developer")
    case _:
        print("The language doesn't matter, what matters is solving problems.")

Output:-
What's the programming language you want to learn?  PHP
You can become a backend developer
```

### Default Value
* Use the underscore character _ as the last case value if you want a code block to execute when there are not other matches:
```python
day = 4
match day:
  case 6:
    print("Today is Saturday")
  case 7:
    print("Today is Sunday")
  case _:
    print("Looking forward to the Weekend")

Output:-
Looking forward to the Weekend
```

### Combine Values
* Use the pipe character | as an or operator in the case evaluation to check for more than one value match in one case:
```python
day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5:
    print("Today is a weekday")
  case 6 | 7:
    print("I love weekends!")

Output:-
Today is a weekday
```

### If Statements as Guards
* You can add if statements in the case evaluation as an extra condition-check:
```python
month = 5
day = 4
match day:
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 4:
    print("A weekday in April")
  case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 if month == 5:
    print("A weekday in May")
  case _:
    print("No match")

Output:-
A weekday in May
```
```python
subject = input("Enter a subject: ")
score = int(input("Enter a score: "))

match subject:
    # if score is 80 or higher in Physics or Chemistry
    case 'Physics' | 'Chemistry' if score >= 80:
        print("Excellent in Science!")
        
    # if score is 80 or higher in English or Grammar
    case 'English' | 'Grammar' if score >= 80:
        print("Excellent in English!")

    # if score is 80 or higher in Maths
    case 'Maths' if score >= 80:
        print("Excellent in Maths!")
        
    case _:
        print(f"Needs improvement in {subject}!")


Output:-
Enter a subject: Physics
Enter a score: 2
Needs improvement in Physics!
```


### Switch Statements Using class
```python
class Python_Switch:
    def day(self, month):
 
        default = "Incorrect day" 
        return getattr(self, 'case_' + str(month), lambda: default)()
 
    def case_1(self):
        return "Jan"
 
    def case_2(self):
        return "Feb"
 
    def case_3(self):
        return "Mar"

my_switch = Python_Switch()
 
print(my_switch.day(1))
print(my_switch.day(3))

Output:-
Jan
Mar
```

### Switch Statements Using function
```python
def number_to_string(argument):
    match argument:
        case 0:
            return "zero"
        case 1:
            return "one"
        case 2:
            return "two"
        case default:
            return "something"
  
 
head = number_to_string(2)
print(head)

Output:- two
```
