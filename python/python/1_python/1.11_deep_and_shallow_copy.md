### Copy an Object in Python?
* In Python, we use = operator to create a copy of an object. You may think that this creates a new object; it doesn't. It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the original object.
```python
old_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 'a']]
new_list = old_list

new_list[2][2] = 9

print('Old List:', old_list)    # output:- Old List: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print('ID of Old List:', id(old_list)) # output:- ID of Old List: 140673303268168

print('New List:', new_list)    # Output:- New List: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
print('ID of New List:', id(new_list))  # Output:- ID of New List: 140673303268168
```

### There are two ways to create copies:
1. Shallow Copy
2. Deep Copy

### Ques. Python Deep Copy and Shallow Copy?
* **Deep Copy:-** In deep copy any changes made to a copy of object do not reflect in the orginal object.
* In deep copy, When we make any changes to a copy of an object, those changes do not reflect in the original object.

### when we any changes in deep copy why do not reflect in original object in python?
* Deep copying in Python ensures that the copy is a completely independent object, with no shared references to the original object or its nested components. This is why changes made to a deep copy do not reflect in the original object.

```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)

new_list[1][0] = 'BB'

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)

Output:- 
Old list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
New list: [[1, 1, 1], ['BB', 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
```
* **Shallow copy:-** A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.
* When we make any changes to a copy of an object, those changes do reflect in the original object because it creates a new object that stores the references of the original elements.
```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)

new_list[1][1] = 'AA'

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)

Output:- 
Old list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 'AA', 2], [3, 3, 3]]
New list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 'AA', 2], [3, 3, 3]]
```
