### Ques. What is Decorators?
* A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.
* Decorators are used to add some design patterns to a function without changing its structure.
* A decorator function is a function that accepts a function as parameter and return a function(decorator ek function hai jo as a argument leta bhi function hai and return bhi function karta hai).
* Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it.
```python
def decor(fun):
    def inner():
        print('befor inhance')
        fun()
        print('after inhance')
    return inner
    
def num():
    print('hello mohit')

result = decor(num)
result()

Output:-
befor inhance
hello mohit
after inhance
```
* 2nd Type
```python
def decor(fun1):
    def inner():
        print('befor inhance')
        fun1()
        print('after inhance')
    return inner
    
@decor   
def num():
    print('hello mohit')
    
num()

Output:-
befor inhance
hello mohit
after inhance
```

```python
def num_decor(num):
    def inner():
        a = num()
        add = a + 5
        return add
    return inner
    
@num_decor
def num():
    return 10

print(num())

Output:- 15

# Example:-
def num_decor(num):
    def inner():
        a = num()
        add = a + 5
        return add
    return inner

def num():
    return 10

result = num_decor(num)
print(result())

Output:- 15
```
