### **Ques. What is python Variables?**
* Variables are containers for storing data values.
* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character.
* A variable name cannot start with a number.
```python
#Legal variable names:
myvar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
myvar2 = "John"
_my_var = "John"

#Illegal variable names:
2myvar = "John"
my-var = "John"
my var = "John"
```
```python
x = 5
y = "Mohit"
print(x)
print(y)

Output:- 
5
Mohit
```

* **Case-Sensitive :** Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
```python
a = 4
A = "Sally"

print(a)
print(A)

Output:-
4
Sally
```

* **Single or Double Quotes:-**  String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
```python
x = "John"
print(x)
#double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 'John'
print(x)

Output:-
John
John
```
* **Assign Multiple Values:** Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line.
```python
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:- 
Orange
Banana
Cherry 
```

* **One Value to Multiple Variables:** And we can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.
```python
x = y = z = "Orange"

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:-
Orange
Orange
Orange
```

* **Variables Casting:** We want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting. and We can **get the data type** of a variable with the **type()** function.
```python
x = str(3)
y = int(3)
z = float(3)

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:- 
3
3
3.0
```
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

Output:-
<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
```

* **Unpack a Collection:** If we have a collection of values in a list, tuple etc. Python allows you to extract the values into variables. This is called unpacking.
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
x, y, z = fruits

print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:-

apple
banana
cherry
```



```python
# double quotes are the same as single quotes:
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "saxena" # x is now of type str
x = 'mohit' # x is now of type str
print(x)

Output:-Mohit
```

```python
x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
   print(x)
   print(y)
   print(z)

output:- Orange<br>Banana<br>Cherry

# Assign Value to Multiple Variables
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

Output:-
Orange
Orange
Orange
```


__Output Variables(combine both text and a variable)__
```python
x = "awesome"
print("Python is " + x)

output:- Python is awesome

# Example 2
-----------
x = "Python is "
y = "awesome"
z =  x + y
print(z)

output:-Python is awesome
```

```python
x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)
```
output:- 15<br>

Note:- If you try to combine a string and a number, Python will give you an error:
```python
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x + y)
output:- TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
```

### Ques. Global Variables?
 * Variables that are created outside of a function.
 * Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
__Example:-__
```python
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()

output:- Python is awesome
```

```python
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
  x = "fantastic"
  print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)

output:- 
Python is fantastic
Python is awesome
```
