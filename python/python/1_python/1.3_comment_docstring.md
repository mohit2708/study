### Ques. Python Comments?
* Comments are hints that we add to our code to make it easier to understand.
* Comments are short descriptions along with the code to increase its readability.
* **single Line Comments:-** Comments starts with a #
```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
__Multi Line Comments(OR)Docstring__
* To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
```python
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```
* you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.
```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

### What is Docstrings?
* In Python, docstrings are a way of documenting modules, classes, functions, and methods. They are written within triple quotes (""" """) and can span multiple lines.
* Python docstrings are strings used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module. They are used to document our code.
* **Example and Accessing Docstrings:-**
```python
class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations.
    """
    def add(self, a, b):
        """
        add(a, b): Return the sum of two numbers.
        """
        return a + b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        """
        multiply(a, b): Return the product of two numbers.
        """
        return a * b

# Accessing the class docstring
print(Calculator.__doc__)

# Accessing the method docstring
print(Calculator.add.__doc__)
print(Calculator.multiply.__doc__)

Output:-
A simple calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations.
add(a, b): Return the sum of two numbers.
multiply(a, b): Return the product of two numbers.
```
```python
def square(n):
    '''Take a number n and return the square of n.'''
    return n**2

print(square.__doc__)

Output:- Take a number n and return the square of n.
```


### Difference between Python comments and docstrings?
* **Comments:** Comments in Python start with a hash mark (#) and are intended to explain the code to developers. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.
* **Docstrings:** Docstrings provide a description of the function, method, class, or module. Unlike comments, they are not ignored by the interpreter and can be accessed at runtime using the .__doc__ attribute.
