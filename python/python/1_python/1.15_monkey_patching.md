### Ques. What is Monkey Patching?
* The term monkey patching refers to dynamic(or run time) modifictaion of class or method.
* A class or method can be changed at the runtime.
```python
class A:  
   def hello(self):  
      print ("The hello() function is being called") 
      
def monkey_f():
    print ("monkey_f() is being called")

#normal class method call   
obj = A()
obj.hello()

#calling class method after monkey patch
obj.hello = monkey_f
obj.hello()

Output:- 
The hello() function is being called
monkey_f() is being called
```
```python
# Original buggy function
def calculate_area(length, width):
  return length * width  # Missing multiplication by 2

# Monkey patch the bug
def fixed_calculate_area(length, width):
  return length * width * 2

calculate_area = fixed_calculate_area

print(calculate_area(5, 3))  # Output: 30 (correctly calculated)
```

```python
# Original Class
class Power:
    def square(self, num):
        return f"Square of {num} is: {num**2}"

# Creating an object of Power
obj = Power()
print(obj.square(3))  # Expected output: Square of 3 is: 9

------------apply moncky paching
# Define the replacement function
def cube(self, num):
    return f"Cube of {num} is: {num**3}"

# Monkey Patching
Power.square = cube  # Assigning the new 'cube' method to replace 'square'

# Testing the patch
obj = Power()
print(obj.square(3))  # Expected output: Cube of 3 is: 27
```
