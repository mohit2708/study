### Ques. What is Monkey Patching?
* The term monkey patching refers to dynamic(or run time) modifictaion of class or method.
* A class or method can be changed at the runtime.
```python
class A:  
   def hello(self):  
      print ("The hello() function is being called") 
      
def monkey_f():
    print ("monkey_f() is being called")

#normal class method call   
obj = A()
obj.hello()

#calling class method after monkey patch
obj.hello = monkey_f
obj.hello()

Output:- 
The hello() function is being called
monkey_f() is being called
```
