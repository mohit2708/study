### **Ques. What is Generator Functions?**
* Generator are functions that returns a sequens of value. we use **yield** statement to return the from function.
* Yield statement returns the element from a generator function into a genrater object.(EX:- yield a)
* This function is used to retrieve element by element from a generator object.(Ex:- next(gen_obj))
* A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values.
* In a generator function, a __yield__ statement is used rather than a return statement.
* The generator function cannot include the return keyword. If you include it, then it will terminate the function. 
* The **difference** between **yield** and **return** is that yield **returns a value and pauses the execution** while maintaining the internal states, whereas the **return statement returns a value and terminates the execution** of the function.

```python
def mygenerator():
    print('First item')
    yield 10

    print('Second item')
    yield 20

    print('Last item')
    yield 30

gen = mygenerator()
print(next(gen))
print(gen.__next__())  # 2 option to write the next function
print(next(gen))
print(next(gen))

Output:- 
First item
10
Second item
20
Last item
30
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<string>", line 22, in <module>
StopIteration

---------------------------------------------------------
# 2nd Option
gen = mygenerator()
while True:
    try:
        print ("Received on next(): ", next(gen))
    except StopIteration:
        break
Output:-
First item
Received on next():  10
Second item
Received on next():  20
Last item
Received on next():  30

# Example 2:-
def bhai(a,b):
    yield a+b
    yield a-b
result = bhai(3,2)
print(next(result))
print(next(result))

Output:- 
5
1

# Example 3:-
def numberPrint():
    n = 1
    while n <= 10:
        sq = n*n
        yield sq
        n += 1
values = numberPrint()
for i in values:
    print(i)

Output:-
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
100
