### Ques. What is File Handling in Python?
* Suppose you are working on a file saved on your personal computer. If you want to perform any operation on that file like opening it, updating it or any other operation on that, all that comes under File handling.
* File handling in Python involves interacting with files on your computer to read data from them or write data to them. Python provides several built-in functions and methods for creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files.
* Types Of File in Python

### Opening a File in Python
* This function takes two arguments. First is the filename along with its complete path, and the other is access mode. This function returns a file object.
* To perform any file operation, the first step is to open the file. Python's built-in open() function is used to open files in various modes, such as reading, writing, and appending. The syntax for opening a file in Python is âˆ’
```python
file = open("filename", "mode")
```


```python
#example 1
print("hello")
# file1 = open("C:\Users\mohits4\Desktop\mohit\study\python\python\1_python\code\example.txt", "r")
file1 = open("example.txt", "r")
print(file1.read())

#example 2
print("hello")
# file1 = open("C:\Users\mohits4\Desktop\mohit\study\python\python\1_python\code\example.txt", "r")
file1 = open("example.txt", "a")
file1.write("Now the file has more content!")
file1.close()
file1 = open("example.txt", "r")
print(file1.read())
```


### **Ques. How to create a new file?**
* create a new file:- "x" - Create - will create a file, returns an error if the file exist.
```python
f = open("myfile.txt", "x")
```

### **How to read file in python?**
* Open a File on the Server:- The **open()** function returns a file object, which has a **read() method** for reading the content of the file.
```python
file = open("file_name.txt", "r")  # Opens the file in read mode
content = file.read()  # Read the content of the file
print(content)
file.close()  # Close the file when done
```
* By default the read() method returns the whole text, but you can also specify how many characters you want to return.
```python
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read(5))

Output:- Hello
```

* The **readline() function** helps you read a **single** line from the file.
```python
file_obj = open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
print(file_obj.readline())
file_obj.close()

Output:-
Hello World
```

* As the name suggests, the **readlines() method** reads **all the lines** in the file and returns them properly separated in a list.
```python
file_obj = open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
print(file_obj.readlines())
file_obj.close()

Output:- 
This is a new file.
We have now learnt all read functions.
We are trying a new method 
to loop over files.
```


* **Close Files:-** It is a good practice to always close the file when you are done with it.
```python
file = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.readline())
file.close()
```

#### How to Write a File in Python
* We're creating it using the **w** mode. Once we open the new file, it's obviously empty. We're then going to write content into it.
* Write - will overwrite any existing content and Create a new file if it does not exist.
```python
file_obj = open("writing.txt", "w")
```

* **a** Append - will append to the end of the file
```python
file = open("writing.txt", "a")
file.write("This way, I will preserve the existing contents in the file")
print(file.read())
file.close()
```

#### Delete File and folder?
* **Delete File** To delete a file, you must **import the OS module**, and run its os.remove() function
```python
import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")
-----------------------------
import os
if os.path.exists("demofile.txt"):
  os.remove("demofile.txt")
else:
  print("The file does not exist")
```

* **Delete Folder** To delete an entire folder, use the os.rmdir() method
* It can only remove empty folders.
```python
import os
os.rmdir("myfolder")
```





#### using with statement?
* The method shown in the above section is not entirely safe. If some exception occurs while opening the file, then the code will exit without closing the file.
```python
# Opening file in read mode and printing the contents of the file.
with open("test.txt", mode='r') as f:
    data = f.readlines() #This reads all the lines from the file in a list.
    print(data) #This will print the content of the Hello World file!

# Opening a file in write mode.
with open("test.txt", mode='w') as f:
    f.write("Data after write operation")
# Opening file in read mode to check the contents.
with open("test.txt", mode='r') as f:
    data = f.readlines() # this reads all the lines from the file in a list.
    print(data) #this will print the overwritten content of the file that is       "Data after write operation"

# Opening a file in append mode and appending data to the file.
with open("test.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write(" Appending new data to the file")
# Opening file in read mode to check the contents.
with open("test.txt", mode='r') as f:
    data = f.readlines() #This reads all the lines from the file in a list.
    print(data) #this will print the existing content of file plus the appended content
```
