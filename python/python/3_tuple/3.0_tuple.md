### **Ques. What is Tuples?**
* Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
* A tuple is a collection which is **ordered** and **unchangeable** and **allow duplicate** values.
* Tuples are written with **round()** brackets.
* A tuple can contain different data types.
  
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana","abc", 34, True, 40, "male")
print(thistuple)
```

### **Tuple Length**
* To determine how many items a tuple has, use the **len()** function
```python
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
print(len(thistuple))

Output:- 3
```

### **Ques. Create Tuple With One Item?**
* We have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
```python
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))

Output:-
<class 'tuple'>
<class 'str'>
```

### Check if Item Exists in tupple
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
if "apple" in thistuple:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple")

Output:- Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits tuple
```

### Tuple() Constructor?
```python
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
print(thistuple)

Output:- ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')
```

### packing and unpacking Tuples?
* packing a Tuple:- When we create a tuple, we normally assign values to it. This is called "packing" a tuple.
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(fruits)

Output:- ('apple', 'banana', 'cherry')

#Example2
def fun(*abc):
    print(abc)
fun(2,5,6)

Output:- (2, 5, 6)

#Example3
def fun(**abc):
    print(abc)
fun(a=2,b=5,c=6)

Output:- {'a': 2, 'b': 5, 'c': 6}
```
* Unpacking a Tuple:- in Python, we are also allowed to extract the values back into variables. This is called "unpacking".
```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
(green, yellow, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(yellow)
print(red)

Output:- 
apple
banana
cherry

# Example2 Using Asterisk (*):-
#If the number of variables is less than the number of values, you can add an * to the variable name and the values will be assigned to the variable as a list. 
fruits = ("apple", "mango", "papaya", "pineapple", "cherry")

(green, *tropic, red) = fruits

print(green)
print(tropic)
print(red)

Output:- 
apple
['mango', 'papaya', 'pineapple']
cherry

# Example3
def fun(a,b,c,d):
    print(a,b,c,d)
list = [2,5,7,4]
fun(*list)

Output:- 2 5 7 4


# Example4
x=[1,5]
print(list(range(*x)))

Output:- [1, 2, 3, 4]
```


### Ques. Difference between List and Tuples in Python?
|                                                     List                                                     |                                            Tuples                                             |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                                   List is mutable. i.e they can be edited.                                   |                 Tuple is immutable. (tuples are lists which can’t be edited).                 |
|                               List iteration is slower and is time consuming.                                |                                  Tuple iteration is faster.                                   |
|                            List is useful for insertion and deletion operations.                             |               Tuple is useful for readonly operations like accessing elements.                |
|                                           List has a large memory.                                           |                                   Tuple has a small memory.                                   |
| List is stored in two blocks of memory (One is fixed sized and the other is variable sized for storing data) |                         Tuple is stored in a single block of memory.                          |
|                                     List provides many in-built methods.                                     |                              Tuples have less in-built methods.                               |
|                                     List operations are more error prone                                     |                                  Tuples operations are safe.                                  |
|      A list has data stored in  square brackets [] brackets. For example, list_1 = [10, ‘Chelsea’, 20]       | A tuple has data stored in parantheses () brackets. For example, tup_1 = (10, ‘Chelsea’ , 20) |
