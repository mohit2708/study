### Copy tuple
* We can use the 'tuple( )' constructor to make a copy of the Tuple.
```python
x = ("Mohan", "Kriti", "Salim")
y = tuple(x)
print(y) 

Output:- ('Mohan', 'Kriti', 'Salim')
```
* With the help of **copy** and **deepcopy**
```python
a = (1, 2, [])
c = copy(a)
d = deepcopy(a)
print(c, d)

Output:- (1, 2, []) (1, 2, [])
```
