### Ques. Python Operators?
1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Assignment operators
3. Comparison operators
4. Logical operators
5. Bitwise operators
6. Membership operators
7. Identity operators

* Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name           | Example |
| :------: | -------------- | ------- |
|    +     | Addition       | x + y   |
|    -     | Subtraction    | x-y     |
|    *     | Multiplication | x * y   |
|    /     | Division       | x / y   |
|    %     | Modulus        | x % y   |
|    **    | Exponentiation | x ** y  |
|    //    | Floor division | x // y  |

* Assignment operators

| Operator | Example | Same As   | Try it                                 |
| :------: | ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
|    =     | x = 5   | x = 5     | x = 5 <br> print(x) <br> 5             |
|    +=    | x += 3  | x = x + 3 | x = 5 <br> x += 3 <br> print(x) <br> 8 |
|    -=    | x -= 3  | x = x - 3 | x = 5 <br> x -= 3 <br> print(x) <br> 2 |
|*=|x *= 3|x = x * 3|x = 5 <br> x *= 3 <br> print(x) <br> 15|
|/=|x /= 3|x = x/3|x = 5 <br> x /= 3 <br> print(x) <br> 1.66|

```python		
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
```

* Comparison Operators



### Ques. difference between membership and identity operators?
### What is membership operators?
* A membership operator in Python checks if a value or variable is present in a sequence(string, list, tuples, sets, dictionary) or not.
* The output of a membership operator is a Boolean value, either True or False.
* There are two membership operators in Python.
1. [In operator](#in-operator)
2. not in' operator

#### in operator
* The ‘in’ operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not. 
```python
#in
x = "Hello, World!"
print("ello" in x) #Returns true as it exists
print("hello" in x) #Returns false as 'h' is in lowercase
print("World" in x)#Returns true as it exists
```
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("banana" in x)

Output:- True
```
```python
list1=[0,2,4,6,8]
list2=[1,3,5,7,9]

check=0
for item in list1:
    if item in list2:
        #Overlapping true so check is assigned 1
        check=1
          
if check==1:
    print("overlapping")
else:
    print("not overlapping")

Output:- not overlapping
```
2. **'not in operator-** Returns True if the target value is not present in a given collection of values. Otherwise, it returns False.
```python
#not in
x = "Hello, World!"
print("ello" not in x) #Returns false as it exists
print("hello" not in x) #Returns true as it does not exist
print("World" not in x) #Returns false as it exists
```
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("pineapple" not in x)

Output:- True
```
```python
a = 70
b = 20
list = [10, 30, 50, 70, 90 ];

if ( a not in list ):
 print("a is NOT in given list")
else:
 print("a is in given list")

if ( b not in list ):
 print("b is NOT present in given list")
else:
  print("b is in given list")

Output:-
a is in given list
b is NOT present in given list
```

### What is Identity operators?
* The Python Identity Operators are used to compare the objects if both the objects are actually of the **same data type** and share the **same memory location**. There are different identity operators such as:
There are two Identity operators in Python.
1. is operator
2. is not operator
    
#### is operator
* is operator returns True if both variables refer to the same object, otherwise, it returns False.
```python
x = 'Educative'
if (type(x) is str):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")
Output:- True
```
#### is not operator
* is not operator returns True if both variables do not refer to the same object, otherwise, it returns False.
```python
x = 6.3
if (type(x) is not float):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")

Outpur:- False
```

### Difference between ‘==’ and ‘is’ Operator?
* The equality operator(==) is used to compare the value of two variables, whereas the identities operator is used to compare the memory location of two variables.
