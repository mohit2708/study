* Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name           | Example |
| :------: | -------------- | ------- |
|    +     | Addition       | x + y   |
|    -     | Subtraction    | x-y     |
|    *     | Multiplication | x * y   |
|    /     | Division       | x / y   |
|    %     | Modulus        | x % y   |
|    **    | Exponentiation | x ** y  |
|    //    | Floor division | x // y  |

* Assignment operators

| Operator | Example | Same As   | Try it                                 |
| :------: | ------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
|    =     | x = 5   | x = 5     | x = 5 <br> print(x) <br> 5             |
|    +=    | x += 3  | x = x + 3 | x = 5 <br> x += 3 <br> print(x) <br> 8 |
|    -=    | x -= 3  | x = x - 3 | x = 5 <br> x -= 3 <br> print(x) <br> 2 |

```python	
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3	
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3	
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3	
//=	x //= 3	x = x // 3	
**=	x **= 3	x = x ** 3	
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3	
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3	
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3	
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3	
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
```

* Python Comparison Operators



### Ques. difference between membership and identity operators?
* **Membership operators:-** Membership operators are operators used to validate the membership of a value.
1. **in operator :** The ‘in’ operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not. 
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("banana" in x)

Output:- True
```
```python
list1=[0,2,4,6,8]
list2=[1,3,5,7,9]

check=0
for item in list1:
    if item in list2:
        #Overlapping true so check is assigned 1
        check=1
          
if check==1:
    print("overlapping")
else:
    print("not overlapping")

Output:- not overlapping
```
2. **'not in' operator-** Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("pineapple" not in x)

Output:- True
```
```python
a = 70
b = 20
list = [10, 30, 50, 70, 90 ];

if ( a not in list ):
 print("a is NOT in given list")
else:
 print("a is in given list")

if ( b not in list ):
 print("b is NOT present in given list")
else:
  print("b is in given list")

Output:-
a is in given list
b is NOT present in given list
```

* **Identity operators** evaluate whether the value being given is of a specific type or class. These operators are commonly used to match the data type of a variable.
1. **is operator:-** The is operator returns true if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object. Otherwise, it returns false.
```python
x = 'Educative'
if (type(x) is str):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")
Output:- True
```
2. **is not operator:-** The is not operator returns false if the variables on either side of the operator point to the same object. Otherwise, it returns true.
```python
x = 6.3
if (type(x) is not float):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")

Outpur:- False
```
