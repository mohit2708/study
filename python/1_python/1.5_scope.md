### Ques. What is Scope in Python?
* Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program.
1. **Local Scope/Local Variables:-** The Variables which are defined in the function are a local scope of the variable. These variables are defined in the function body.
```python
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
    x = "fantastic"
    print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)

Output:-
Python is fantastic
Python is awesome
```
2. **Global Scope/Global Variables:-** The Variable which can be read from anywhere in the program is known as a global scope. These variables can be accessed inside and outside the function. 
```python
x = 300
def myfunc():
    print(x)
myfunc()

print(x)
Output:- 300
300
```
3. **NonLocal or Enclosing Scope:-** Nonlocal Variable is the variable that is defined in the nested function. It means the variable can be neither in the local scope nor in the global scope.
```python
def func_outer():
    x = "local"
    def func_inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = "nonlocal"
        print("inner:", x)
    func_inner()
    print("outer:", x)
func_outer()

Output:-
inner: nonlocal
outer: nonlocal   
```

4. **Built-in Scope:-** If a Variable is not defined in local, Enclosed or global scope, then python looks for it in the built-in scope. In the Following Example, 1 from math module pi is imported, and the value of pi is not defined in global, local and enclosed. Python then looks for the pi value in the built-in scope and prints the value. Hence the name which is already present in the built-in scope should not be used as an identifier.
```python
# Built-in Scope 
from math import pi 
# pi = 'Not defined in global pi'
def func_outer(): 
    # pi = 'Not defined in outer pi' 
    def inner(): 
        # pi = 'not defined in inner pi' 
        print(pi) 
    inner() 
func_outer()

Output:- 3.141592
```
### **Ques. global Keyword?**
* To create a global keyword inside a function should be treated as a global variable, you can use the global keyword.
```python
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)
Output:- Python is fantastic
```
* Also, use the global keyword if you want to change a global variable inside a function.
```python
x = 10  # Global variable
def modify_global():
    global x
    x = 20  # Changing the value of the global variable

modify_global()
print(x)  # This will print 20
```
