### Ques. Python Comments?
__single Line Comments:-__ Comments starts with a #
```python
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
__Multi Line Comments(OR)Docstring__
* To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line.
```python
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```
* you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it.
```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

### What is Docstrings?
* In Python, docstrings are a way of documenting modules, classes, functions, and methods. They are written within triple quotes (""" """) and can span multiple lines.
* **Example and Accessing Docstrings:-**
```python
class Calculator:
    """
    A simple calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations.

    Methods:
    - add(a, b): Return the sum of two numbers.
    - multiply(a, b): Return the product of two numbers.
    """
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

# Accessing the class docstring
print(Calculator.__doc__)

# Accessing the method docstring
print(Calculator.add.__doc__)
print(Calculator.multiply.__doc__)

Output:-

    A simple calculator class to perform basic arithmetic operations.

    Methods:
    - add(a, b): Return the sum of two numbers.
    - multiply(a, b): Return the product of two numbers.
    
 add function 
None
```

### Difference between Python comments and docstrings?
* **Comments:** Comments in Python start with a hash mark (#) and are intended to explain the code to developers. They are ignored by the Python interpreter.
* **Docstrings:** Docstrings provide a description of the function, method, class, or module. Unlike comments, they are not ignored by the interpreter and can be accessed at runtime using the .__doc__ attribute.


### Ques. What is PEP 8?
* PEP stands for **Python Enhancement Proposal**. 
* It is a set of rules that specify how to format Python code for maximum readability.
* PEP8 is a document that provides various guidline to write the readable in python.
* PEP8 describe how the developers can write the beautiful code.

### Ques. Is indentation required in python?
Indentation is necessary for Python. It specifies a block of code. All code within loops, classes, functions, etc is specified within an indented block. It is usually done using four space characters. If your code is not indented necessarily, it will not execute accurately and will throw errors as well.
