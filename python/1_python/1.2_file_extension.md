### Ques. File Extensions in Python?
* __.pyâ€“__ The normal extension for a Python source file
* __.pyc-__ The compiled bytecode
* __.pyd-__ A Windows DLL file
* __.pyo-__ A file created with optimizations
* __.pyw-__ A Python script for Windows
* __.pyz-__ A Python script archive


### Ques. What is the difference between .py and .pyc files?
* **.py** files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, **.pyc** file contains the bytecode of your program. 
* We get bytecode after compilation of **.py** file (source code). **.pyc** files are not created for all the files that you run. It is only created for the files that you import.

### Ques. What is an Interpreted language?
* An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line. Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages.

### Ques. What is a dynamically typed language?
* Type-checking can be done at two stages:-
1. **Static-** Data Types are checked before execution.
2. **Dynamic-** Data Types are checked during execution.
Python is an interpreted language, executes each statement line by line and thus type-checking is done on the fly, during execution. Hence, Python is a Dynamically Typed Language.
