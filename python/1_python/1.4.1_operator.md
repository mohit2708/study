### **Ques. What is membership operator and identity operators?**
*  **Membership Operators:-** These operators help validate whether a given element is present in or is a member of the given sequence of data. This sequence of data can be a list, string or a tuple<br>There are 2 types of Membership operater
1. in Operator:
```python
lst1 = ['Ajay', 'Bobby','Ashok', 'Vijay', 'Anil', 'Rahul','Alex', 'Christopher']
if 'Ajay' in lst1: 
    print('Name Ajay exists in lst1')

Output:- Name Ajay exists in lst1
```
2. not in Operator:
```python
lst1 = ['Ajay', 'Bobby','Ashok', 'Vijay', 'Anil', 'Rahul','Alex', 'Christopher']
   if 'Raghav' not in lst1: 
   print ('Name Raghav does not exists in lst1')

output:- Name Raghav exists in lst1
```

* **Identity Operators:-** These operators help in determining whether a value belongs to a certain class or a certain type, i.e they help in determining the identity of the object. It is useful in finding out the data type a variable holds.

1. is Operator:
```python
a = 'London'
b = 'London'

if a is b: print ('a is b')
else: print ('a is not b')

if a is c: print('a is c')
else: print ('a is not c')   

Output:- 
a is b
a is not c
```

2. is not	Operator:
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is not z)
print(x is not y)
print(x != y)

Output:- 
False
True
False
```

<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3
```

* Comparison Operators



### Ques. difference between membership and identity operators?




### What is membership operators?
* A membership operator in Python checks if a value or variable is present in a sequence(string, list, tuples, sets, dictionary) or not.
* The output of a membership operator is a Boolean value, either True or False.
* There are two membership operators in Python.
1. [In operator](#in-operator)
2. not in' operator

#### in operator
* The ‘in’ operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not. 
```python
#in
x = "Hello, World!"
print("ello" in x) #Returns true as it exists
print("hello" in x) #Returns false as 'h' is in lowercase
print("World" in x)#Returns true as it exists
```
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("banana" in x)

Output:- True
```
```python
list1=[0,2,4,6,8]
list2=[1,3,5,7,9]

check=0
for item in list1:
    if item in list2:
        #Overlapping true so check is assigned 1
        check=1
          
if check==1:
    print("overlapping")
else:
    print("not overlapping")

Output:- not overlapping
```
2. **'not in operator-** Returns True if the target value is not present in a given collection of values. Otherwise, it returns False.
```python
#not in
x = "Hello, World!"
print("ello" not in x) #Returns false as it exists
print("hello" not in x) #Returns true as it does not exist
print("World" not in x) #Returns false as it exists
```
```python
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("pineapple" not in x)

Output:- True
```
```python
a = 70
b = 20
list = [10, 30, 50, 70, 90 ];

if ( a not in list ):
 print("a is NOT in given list")
else:
 print("a is in given list")

if ( b not in list ):
 print("b is NOT present in given list")
else:
  print("b is in given list")

Output:-
a is in given list
b is NOT present in given list
```

### What is Identity operators?
* The Python Identity Operators are used to compare the objects if both the objects are actually of the **same data type** and share the **same memory location**. There are different identity operators such as:
There are two Identity operators in Python.
1. is operator
2. is not operator
    
#### is operator
* is operator returns True if both variables refer to the same object, otherwise, it returns False.
```python
x = 'Educative'
if (type(x) is str):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")
Output:- True
```
#### is not operator
* is not operator returns True if both variables do not refer to the same object, otherwise, it returns False.
```python
x = 6.3
if (type(x) is not float):
    print("true")
else:
    print("false")

Outpur:- False
```

### Difference between ‘==’ and ‘is’ Operator?
* The equality operator(==) is used to compare the value of two variables, whereas the identities operator is used to compare the memory location of two variables.
