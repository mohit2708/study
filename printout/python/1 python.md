### **Ques. Features of Python?**
1. __Easy:-__ Python is very easy to learn and understand; using this Python tutorial, any beginner can understand the basics of Python.
2. __Interpreted:-__ It is interpreted(executed) line by line. This makes it easy to test and debug.
3. __Object-Oriented:-__ The Python programming language supports classes and objects. We discussed these above.
4. __Free and Open Source:-__ The language and its source code are available to the public for free; there is no need to buy a costly license.
5. __Portable:-__ Since it is open-source, you can run Python on Windows, Mac, Linux or any other platform. Your programs will work without needing to the changed for every machine.
6. __GUI Programming:-__ You can use it to develop a GUI (Graphical User Interface). One way to do this is through Tkinter.
7. __Large Library:-__ Python provides you with a large standard library. You can use it to implement a variety of functions without needing to reinvent the wheel every time. Just pick the code you need and continue. This lets you focus on other important tasks.
