### **Ques. What Is Foreign Key?**
* A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together. This is something called a reference key.
* Foreign key is a column or a combination of columns whose values match a primary key in a different table.
* The relationship between two tables matches the primary key in one of the tables with a foreign key in the second table.
