### **Ques. What are Constraints in SQL?**
Constraints are used to specify the rules concerning data in the table. It can be applied for single or multiple fields in an SQL table during the creation of the table or after creating using the ALTER TABLE command. The constraints are:<br>
* **NOT NULL** - Restricts NULL value from being inserted into a column.
* **CHECK** - Verifies that all values in a field satisfy a condition.
* **DEFAULT** - Automatically assigns a default value if no value has been specified for the field.
* **UNIQUE** - Ensures unique values to be inserted into the field.
* **INDEX** - Indexes a field providing faster retrieval of records.
* **PRIMARY KEY** - Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
* **FOREIGN KEY** - Ensures referential integrity for a record in another table.



3. **Intersect:-** 
* The intersect opertor returns the common records from two or more select statements.
* These are the records that exist in both Dataset1 and Dataset2.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2
```
4. **Minus:-** 
* MINUS operator will return only those rows which are unique in only first SELECT query and not those rows which are common to both first and second SELECT queries.
```sql
SELECT column1 , column2 , ... columnN FROM table_name
MINUS
SELECT column1 , column2 , ... columnN FROM table_name
```


**[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**
### **What is Cursor?**
* WHEN WE USE SELECT STMT IN DATABASE(ORACLE/SQLSERVER/MYSQL) ,   it allocate memory for that known as cursor.
* A cursor is a pointer to this context area. PL/SQL controls the context area through a Cursor.
* A Cursor can hold more than one row, but can process only one row at a time. The set of rows the cursor hold is called the active set.
* A cursor is a temporary work area created in the system memory when a SQL statement is executed. A cursor contains information on a select statement and the rows of data accessed by it.
* This temporary work area is used to store the data retrieved from the database and manipulate this data.

#### There are two type of cursor in PL/SQL:-

1. **Implicit cursor:-**
   * These are creating by default when DML statement like, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statement are executed. They are also created when a SELECT statement that returns just one row is executed.
   * Implicit cursors are automatically created by oracle whenever an SQL statement is executed, when there is no explicit cursor for the statement. Programmers cannot control the implicit cursor and the information in it.


### Difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?
| Having                                                           | Where                                                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Having ke sath GROUP BY use hota hai                             |                                                                            |
| Having post filter hai(data fatch hone ke baad filter lagta hai) | where pre filter hai(isme pahle filter lagta hai phir fatch data hota hai) |
| having can be used only with select command                      | can be used with select update delete                                      |
| HAVING is used for column operations.                            | WHERE is used for row operations                                           |
| having ke aggrigate function sath kar sakte hai                  | where ke sath aggrigate function use nahi kar sakte                        |
```sql
a   c1  40
a   c2  50
b   c3  30
c   c1  20

select std, sum(score) as total from record group by std having total>60;
```

### **Ques. Difference between In and Between Operator in SQL?**
* BETWEEN operator is used to select a range of data between two values while The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values.
* The BETWEEN operator selects a range of data between two values. The values can be numbers, text,etc.
* The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values.
```sql
+----+----------+--------+
| ID | NAME     | mark   |
+----+----------+--------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |   89   |
|  2 | Khilan   |   81   |
|  3 | kaushik  |   73   |
|  3 | kaushik  |   67   |
|  4 | Chaitali |   52   |

### **List of Mysql storage Engines/Table Type?**
Mysql ne apni requirment ke according alag-alag table type diye hai.
1. MyIsam:-
* Myisam good for select command.
* it support full text searching.
* it support table level locking.
* it support Blob and text column can be indexed.
2. Innodb
* it support for referential integrity.
* it support foreign key constraint.
* it support Row level locking.
* it support for transaction. 
3. CSV
* The CSV storage engine stores data in text file using comma separated values format.
4. Archive
5. memory 
6. black hole
7. merge

### **Ques. What is Stored procedure?**
* Stored procedure is a function which cantains a collection of sql quries, the procedure can take inputs, process them and send back output.
* Stored procedure is a database object which is used to perform some specific task.
* Stored procedure is called explicitly.
* Store procedures is set of structure Query language (SQL) statement that perform particular task.
* Store procedures is set of structure Query language (SQL) statement with an assigned name, which are stored in a relation database 
management system as a group, so it can be reused and shered by multipal program.
* Advantage: Stored Procedures are precompiled and stored in the database. This enables the Database to execute the queries much faster. Since many queries can be included in a stored procedure, round trip time to execute multiple queries from source code to
Database and back is avoided.
* A procedure is a group of SQL statement that you can call by name.
* Store procedures is a database object which is used to perform some specific task.

__Advantage__
* Store procedure is reducing the complexity of code in code behind.
* Store procedures have repeatedly having data. It helps to reuse the code.
* It store in precompiled format so execution of speed is much faster than SQL statement.

```
1. Store procedures explicitly call hote hai.
2. Tiger automatic call hote hai.
3. Function inside the sql call hote hai.
```

```sql
create procedure procedure_name as
begain
  select name, age from emp;
end

execute procedure_name
```

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE ABCD
IS 
BEGIN
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('JAI PL BABA');
END;
sql>EXECUTE ABCD (sql>set serveroutput on)
```
```sql
ALTER procedure [dbo].[inemp]
@eno int,@enm varchar(20),@sl int
as
begin
insert into emp(EMPNO,ENAME,SAL) values(@eno,@enm,@sl);
end
```



### **Ques. What is Json?**
* Json stands for Javascript Object Notation and Json is lightweight data interchange format.
* Json is syntax for storing and exchanging data.
* it is easy for machine to parse and recreates.
* Json is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.

__JSON Advantage__
* JSON does not have namespace.
* JSON is not extensible.




# **Sql Query:-**



#### 2nd highest salary?
* __Using Subquery:-__
```sql
SELECT salary FROM (SELECT salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS Emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;
```
* Using Limit:-
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees WHERE salary NOT IN ( SELECT Max(salary) FROM employees); (OR)
SELECT MAX (SAL) FROM EMP WHERE SAL < (SELECT MAX (SAL) FROM EMP);
```

```sql
Using Sub query and < operator instead of IN clause:-
SELECT MAX(salary)
From employees
WHERE salary < ( SELECT Max(salary) FROM employees);
```




### **Ques. is a blank space or zero the same as a null value in sql?**
No 

### **Current date?**
```sql
select GETDATE();
```




### **What is Json?**
* Json stands for Javascript Object Notation and Json is lightweight data interchange format.
* Json is syntax for storing and exchanging data.
* it is easy for machine to parse and recreates.

### Ques. What is ACID property/SQL TRANSACTIONS?
* Transactions group a set of tasks into a single execution unit. Each transaction begins with a specific job and ends when all the tasks in the group successfully completed. If any of the tasks fail, the transaction fails. Therefore, a transaction has only two results: success or failure.
* Example of a transaction to transfer $150 from account A to account B:
```php
1. read(A)
2. A:= A – 150
3. write(A)
4. read(B)
5. B:= B + 150
6. write(B)
```
* ACID property is used to ensure that the data transactions are processed reliably in a database system.
* A single logical operation of a data is called transaction.
* ACID is an acronym for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. 

* **Atomicity: -** 
  * It requires that each transaction is all or nothing. It means if one part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction fails and the database state is left unchanged.
  * A transaction consists of many steps. When all the steps in a transaction get completed, it will get reflected in DB or if any step fails, all the transactions are rolled back.
__Consistency:__
* The consistency property ensures that the data must meet all validation rules. In simple words you can say that your transaction never leaves your database without completing its state.
* The database will move from one consistent state to another, if the transaction succeeds and remain in the original state, if the transaction fails.
Isolation:
 This property ensures that the concurrent property of execution should not be met. The
main goal of providing isolation is concurrency control.
 Every transaction should operate as if it is the only transaction in the system.
Durability:
 Durability simply means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so,
come what may even power loss, crashes or errors.
 Once a transaction has completed successfully, the updated rows/records must be
available for all other transactions on a permanent basis

1.  What are types of locks?
2. Sheared lock: When a shared lock is applied on data item, other transactions can only read the
item, but can&#39;t write into it.
1. Exclusive lock: When an exclusive lock is applied on data item, other transactions can&#39;t read or
write into the data item.
