### **Aliases?**
* Aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.
* An alias is created with the **AS** keyword.

#### Alias Column Syntax:-
```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

-- Basic Column Alias
SELECT first_name AS name, last_name AS surname FROM employees;

-- Using quotes for aliases with spaces
SELECT 
    first_name AS 'Employee First Name',
    last_name AS 'Employee Last Name',
    salary AS 'Monthly Compensation'
FROM 
    employees;
    
-- Without AS keyword
SELECT first_name name, last_name surname FROM employees;

-- Simple Table Alias
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e JOIN departments d 
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- Calculation with Alias
SELECT 
    product_name, 
    price * quantity AS total_value,
    (price * quantity) * 1.1 AS total_with_tax
FROM products;

-- Concatenation Alias
SELECT 
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
    email AS contact_email
FROM customers;

-- Subquery with Alias
SELECT 
    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS avg_salary,
    (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS max_salary;

-- Aggregate Function Aliases
SELECT 
    department_id,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
    MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Conditional Aliases
SELECT 
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN salary < 50000 THEN 'Junior'
        WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Mid-Level'
        ELSE 'Senior'
    END AS salary_category
FROM employees;
